## IBM Data Engineering Course Project -  Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks


 + ### In this project, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) operations on real-world data. The task was to compile a list of the top 10 largest banks globally, ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. The challenge extended further as I had to transform and store the data in GBP, EUR, and INR using exchange rate information provided in a CSV file. The final output, a processed information table, was saved both locally in CSV format and as a database table.

+ ### Key Learnings -
  + Webscraping - extract information from websites as per specific requirements
  + Pandas - pandas data frames and dictionaries
  + ETL - application of Extraction, Transformation, and Loading operations in a real-world scenario
  + Multi-Format Output - saving processed infromation in CSV files and as a database table, demonstrating versatility in data presentation.
  + SQLite3 and Pandas Database Queries - Querying the database tables using SQLite3 and Pandas libraries
