## IBM Data Engineering Course Project -  Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks


 + ### During this project, I had the chance to apply my expertise in conducting Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) operations on real-world data. The primary objective was to create a comprehensive list of the top 10 largest global banks, sorted by market capitalization in billion USD. The complexity increased as I needed to convert and store the data in multiple currencies, namely GBP, EUR, and INR, utilizing exchange rate information from a provided CSV file. The final result was a refined information table, stored locally in CSV format and as a database table. Additionally, I utilized SQLite3 to execute queries on the database files.


+ ### Key Learnings -
  + Webscraping - extract information from websites as per specific requirements
  + Pandas - pandas data frames and dictionaries
  + ETL - application of Extraction, Transformation, and Loading operations in a real-world scenario
  + Multi-Format Output - saving processed infromation in CSV files and as a database table, demonstrating versatility in data presentation.
  + SQLite3 and Pandas Database Queries - Querying the database tables using SQLite3 and Pandas libraries
